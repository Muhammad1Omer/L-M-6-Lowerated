### What is an attribute?

- An attribute refers to a characteristic or quality of something that can be observed, measured, or evaluated.
- In the context of rating or evaluating entities (such as products, services, or experiences), attributes are specific aspects or features that contribute to their overall quality, performance, or value.
- These attributes are typically used as criteria for assessment and comparison. For example, in rating a smartphone, attributes may include performance, camera quality, battery life, design, user interface, and price.
- Each attribute provides a distinct perspective on the entity being evaluated, helping to form a comprehensive and nuanced judgment.
- Attributes can be quantitative (e.g., speed, size, weight) or qualitative (e.g., style, comfort, ease of use).
- They can also be subjective (e.g., taste, preference) or objective (e.g., technical specifications, performance metrics).
- The choice of attributes to consider when evaluating an entity depends on the specific context and the intended purpose of the evaluation.
