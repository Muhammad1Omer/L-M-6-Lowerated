## Things To Do

1. ~~Adding Custom Entity without Effecting the Default Ones.~~
2. Extract Info from reviews i.e. Sentiments From Text against attributes.
4. Assigning Weights to Critic's Review.
5. Testing Better Models for Sentiments.
6. Removing Biasness from Text.
7. Fill Missing Information (an attribute's information isn't available in text, how can we assign a number?)
8. Pip install Lowerated
9. Surveys to improve the default attributes.
10. Scraping Movies Reviews (with their original ratings)
11. Scraping Book Reviews (with their original ratings)
12. Scraping e-com products' Reviews (with their star ratings)
13. Compare All ratings (IMDB, GoodReads, Amazon Ratings) with Lowerated's rating.
14. Design a Generalized Recommendation System take takes in any information about user, and all the items that can be suggested and returns a sorted list of items based on user's information (rating algorithm is also used).
